# Disaster-Tweets
Disaster tweets classification is a kaggle competition. The aim is classifying if tweets are about disasters.

In the repository there are 2 notebooks:<br/>

  -Disaster Tweets (Preprocessing): This notebook preprocesses the input data.<br/>
  -Disaster Tweet Classification (ML): In this notebook I fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model from tensorflow-hub. Afterwards, I use it to predict the test samples.<br/>

NOTE: If Disaster Tweet Classification (ML) is not being displayed, You can check the colab notebook (exactly the same as the one that should be displayed here) below:<br/>

The data is from kaggle. In the notbooks there are links to the data.

pip install requirements.txt should install the required libraries. It is prefferable to run in a virtual environment.
